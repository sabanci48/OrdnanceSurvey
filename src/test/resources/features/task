Engagement Services – Test Analyst/Engineer Tech Task

To help us understand your technical capabilities and the use of automation frameworks and tools, we would like you to complete
 one or more of the following tasks.
During your interview you will be allocated time to provide a demonstration of your work and approach, detailing how you created
the frameworks or used the client tools to achieve the goal. We would like the created frameworks or use of tools to work during
your demonstration but is not required as long as you have demonstrated a good understanding and have shown a sound approach.


Task 1:
• Create a new Selenium framework using your chosen language (Java/Python/C# etc….) within your preferred IDE.
• Create a single Cucumber feature file to verify the below scenario.
• Configure the framework to execute the test scenario against the Chrome browser. You need to show how to trigger this
manually and also via the build process.
• Provide details related to test reports produced by the test execution.

Scenario:
Using the URL https://osdatahub.os.uk/, verify specific items/objects are loaded onto the page.
Navigate through the header menu including verification steps to confirm that the correct page is showing and that
the page objects are displayed.
For the ‘Docs’ page, verify the items on the side menu
 and verify the links shown when
you expand the listed sections under ‘OS Data Hub documentation’ e.g. ‘OS Downloads API’, ‘OS Features API’,
 ‘OS Linked Identifiers API’ etc……


Task 2:
• Using the following API endpoint, and a library such as REST Assured within an IDE of your choice, create a set of automated
test scenarios to verify the response status and its payload including the returned attributes and corresponding values.
Note: you don’t have to verify all of the payload, just a portion of it.
